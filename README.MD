## Goal
I want to have a simple front end that can update a small database backend
Keep it VERY SIMPLE!!!!


### First of all what is the difference between Django and Flask
They are a user friendly front end to update a database.
They are both open sourced and used with python

Django
- User authentication and authorization
- More powerful
Flask
- Simpler
- Not as powerful
- Doesn't have the power to do user authentication or authorization
